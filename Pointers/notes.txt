pointers
--------

--> pointers are variables which store address of another variable it points to address of that variable
--> if we want an address of an variable we use (&) before the variable
--> if we want the value of an address of that variable we use (*)

Declaration:

    var <pointer name> *<data type> = &(another variable)

or

    var ptr = &(another variable)

or
    
    ptr := &(another variable)

Passing by value:
--> whenever we want update a value by using a function, when we use direct variables without pointers it doesnt update because the scopes of these variable is different

passing by reference:

--> but when we use concept of pointers we can update the value of variable without returning anything 
--> and for slices we doesnt need pointers it will change by default
--> same as slices maps doesnt need the concept of pointers

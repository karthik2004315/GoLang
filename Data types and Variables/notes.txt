Datatypes
---------

1. String: strings are used to represent text and they are surrounded by ("") or ('').

2. Number: It is of two types
    a) Integer: it can be uint(unsigned integer) or int 

    b) Float: it is of two types "float32" or "float 64"

3. Booleans: it has two values true or false.

4. Arrays: it is an collection of similar data type elements

5. Slices: it is also an container like array but it is more flexible than arrays

6. Maps: these are key value pairs and keys and values can be anything like string or number.

Dynamically vs statically typed languages
-----------------------------------------

--> Statically typed languages means it throws an error at compile time when used wrong data type ex: cpp, java.
--> Dynamically typed languages does not enforce data type system ex: python, javascript
--> both has advantages of their own 

what about GO??

--> go has a concept of data types explicitly declared by programmer or inferred by the compiler

Variables
---------
--> variables are used to store the data

syntax:
   var <variable name> <data type> = <value>

ex:
    var hi string = "Go"

Print and Println
-----------------
--> we can use print or println but using print doesnt give new line whereas println always goes to new line after printing
--> there is other way we can print too

printf - format specifier
------------------------

1. %v -- prints the value in default format
2. %d -- formats integers
3. %T -- prints the type of the variable

Zero values
-----------
when we print and un assigned variable we get a default value or zero value which is different for different types of variables

for string  --> ("")
for integer --> (0)
for float   --> (0.0)
for bool    --> (false)

taking input
------------
we use scanf for scanning input values from user we scan it by passing format specifiers
